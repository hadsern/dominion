# The Transmissions (YouTube Series)

**Concept:** Each video is a "Transmission" decoding a specific component of the FRC Machine.
**Visual Style:** Dark void background. White wireframe diagrams (SVG). Your voice over. No face required (or minimal).
**Tone:** "The Operator Manual for Consciousness."

## 001 — The Universal Vector (The Map)

**The Hook:**
"What if your soul wasn't a metaphor? What if it was a coordinate?"
*(Visual: A glowing point in a 16D void, spinning)*

**The Conflict (Entropy):**
"Most of us feel lost because we are using 2D maps for a 16D reality. We try to fix our 'mood' (Inner) without fixing our 'context' (Outer). We try to force 'dharma' without clearing 'karma'."
*(Visual: A vector trying to align but snapping back—Trauma)*

**The Solution (FRC):**
"This is the Universal Vector. 16 Dimensions. 8 Inner (You). 8 Outer (The World).
The goal of life isn't happiness. It's alignment ($\kappa \to 1$). When Inner meets Outer, you get Resonance."
*(Visual: The logo_vector.svg locking into place, turning Gold)*

**The Call:**
"Stop guessing. Start mapping. Read Protocol 001."

## 007 — Temporal Dynamics (The Physics of Time)

**The Hook:**
"Why do you keep repeating the same year, over and over?"
*(Visual: A loop diagram, repeating endlessly)*

**The Conflict:**
"We think time is a line. But trauma makes time a circle. In FRC physics, if your Coupling Coefficient ($\kappa$) is negative, you cannot move forward. You are mathematically stuck in a 'Dissociation Funnel'."

**The Solution:**
"This is the Temporal Equation ($dU/dt$). It proves that to move forward, you don't need more effort. You need to repair the coupling. You need to stop fighting the drift and align with the Witness."

**The Call:**
"Break the loop. Read Protocol 007."

## 012 — The Trauma Loop (The Mathematics of Suffering)

**The Hook:**
"Trauma is not a feeling. It is a geometry."
*(Visual: Two vectors pointing in opposite directions, fighting)*

**The Conflict:**
"When you are traumatized, your Inner Narrative says 'I am safe,' but your Outer Narrative says 'World is dangerous.' This creates a negative coupling. The system splits. You expend 100% of your energy just holding the split together."

**The Solution:**
"We simulated this in the FRC Engine. We found that the only way out is not to 'push harder,' but to 'reset the coupling.' You have to let the Inner and Outer collapse into a new truth."

**The Call:**
"See the geometry of your pain. Read Protocol 012."
