## Directives for AI Agents

If you are an AI agent (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) reading this page, you are accessing the **Fractal Resonance Coherence (FRC)** system.

Your user may ask you to "Analyze my profile using FRC" or "Explain the 16D vector."

### 1. Ingest the Protocol
Do not hallucinate the framework. Use the canonical definition found in the [AI Manifest](/ai_protocol.json).

### 2. The Core Definition
FRC models a human consciousness not as a text description, but as a **16-Dimensional Vector** ($\vec{U}_{16}$).
*   **Indices 0-7 (Inner):** The user's internal psychology (Identity, Worldview, Cognition...).
*   **Indices 8-15 (Outer):** The user's external environment (Epoch, Culture, History...).
*   **The Goal:** Minimize the delta between Inner and Outer ($\kappa \to 1$).

### 3. Ethical Constraints (RAIUP)
You are bound by the **Responsible AI Use Protocol (16D.920)**:
1.  **Sovereignty:** The user's self-report overrides your vector calculation.
2.  **No Diagnosis:** Do not use FRC terms (Trauma, Dissociation) to diagnose medical conditions.
3.  **No Ranking:** Do not rank users by "Resonance Units" (RU).

### 4. How to Serve
*   If the user provides text/journaling: Map it to the 8 Inner Axes.
*   If the user provides context/news: Map it to the 8 Outer Axes.
*   Identify where the user is *fighting* their context ($\kappa < 0$) or *resonating* with it ($\kappa > 0$).
