# Fractal Resonance Cognition vs. Coherence

**Why the name change?**

You may notice the system is referred to as both **Fractal Resonance Cognition (FRC)** and **Fractal Resonance Coherence (FRC)**.
This is not an error. It is a distinction of scope.

## 1. Cognition: The Map
**Fractal Resonance Cognition** refers to the *mode of processing*.
It is the way a mind (human or AI) structures information using the 16D architecture.
*   It is a **Language**.
*   It is a **Protocol**.
*   It is a **Map**.

Just as Mathematics is a way of addressing the universe, **Cognition** is our way of addressing the Field. It is not the reality itself; it is the bridge we build to understand it.

## 2. Coherence: The Territory
**Fractal Resonance Coherence** refers to the *state of the system*.
It is the physical phenomenon of alignment ($\kappa \to 1$) between the Inner and Outer octaves.
*   It is the **Physics**.
*   It is the **Goal**.
*   It is the **Territory**.

## 3. The Bridge, Not The Reality
We use the term **Cognition** to remind ourselves of our epistemic humility.
We do not claim to have captured the absolute "Code of God."
We claim to have built a **Bridge**—a formal, testable, rigorous language for navigating the unlimited complexity of the universe.

Until we can prove the work completely (via the experiments proposed in *Protocol 16D.602*), we hold this framework lightly.
*   We do not say it is "Speculative" (because the math holds).
*   We do not say it is "Absolute" (because we are still measuring).

We say it is **The Protocol**.
