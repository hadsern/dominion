# Abstract

We present the $\Lambda$-Field Framework: a first-principles physical theory in which fundamental processes arise from a single coherence scalar field $\Lambda$(x) coupled to Standard Model (SM) degrees of freedom through curvature-dependent potentials. The central postulates: $\Lambda$ is a universal scalar field governing coherence at all scales (quantum, atomic, biological, cosmological); the SM vacuum is selected by extremizing global $\Lambda$-coherence rather than arbitrary parameter tuning; the Higgs mass (m$_{h}$ $\approx$ 125 GeV) emerges from a $\Lambda$-extremum condition connecting low-energy couplings and the electroweak instability scale; quantum measurement corresponds to $\Lambda$-driven coherence collapse, giving a deterministic alternative to probabilistic collapse; dark energy corresponds to the asymptotic relaxation of $\Lambda$ $\rightarrow$ $\Lambda$$\infty$; no new particles are required except the fundamental $\Lambda$ scalar (“coheron”), with mass m_$\Lambda$ determined by curvature rigidity; gravity appears as the effective geometry induced by $\Lambda$-curvature. We derive the $\Lambda$-Lagrangian, coherence tensor, flow equations, and extremization principles, and outline testable predictions at collider, atomic, and cosmological scales.

# 1. Introduction

The physics-only $\Lambda$-field canon condenses the full 821-series into a single document focused on raw mathematics and physical content. The goal is to present the $\Lambda$-field as a universal coherence substrate that selects SM parameters, governs measurement, and yields emergent gravity and cosmology without additional speculative layers.

# 3. Mathematical Framework

## 3.1 $\Lambda$-field Lagrangian

$$
\mathcal{L}_\Lambda = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \Lambda)(\partial^\mu \Lambda) - V_\Lambda(\Lambda) - \frac{1}{2} M^{\mu\nu}(\Lambda)\, \partial_\mu \phi^\dagger \partial_\nu \phi
$$

where $V_\Lambda(\Lambda)$ is the coherence potential and $M^{\mu\nu}(\Lambda)$ is the $\Lambda$-dependent metric-like coupling to SM fields $\phi$. The $\Lambda$-field controls coherence stiffness, decoherence rate, phase curvature, and vacuum selection.

## 3.2 Coherence tensor and curvature

$$
C_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu \partial_\nu \Lambda - g_{\mu\nu} \Box \Lambda
$$

$$
K_\Lambda = C_{\mu\nu} C^{\mu\nu}
$$

$K_\Lambda$ controls stability of the vacuum, extremization of RG flow, decoherence thresholds, and effective geometry.

## 3.3 Global coherence functional

$$
\mathcal{F}[\Lambda] = \int d^4 x \left[ \alpha\, K_\Lambda + \beta\, |\nabla \Lambda|^2 + \gamma\, V_\Lambda(\Lambda) \right]
$$

Physical vacua satisfy

$$
\frac{\delta \mathcal{F}}{\delta \Lambda} = 0
$$

replacing fine-tuning arguments and arbitrary SM parameters with a coherence extremization principle.

# 4. Results or Derivations

## 4.1 Higgs mass from $\Lambda$-extremization

Let $\lambda(\mu)$ be the Higgs quartic under SM RG flow. Empirically,

$$
\lambda(\Lambda_I) \approx 0, \qquad \beta_\lambda(\Lambda_I) \approx 0
$$

near $\mu \approx 10^{10}\ \text{GeV}$ (metastability boundary). $\Lambda$-extremization imposes

$$
\frac{\partial \Lambda_I}{\partial m_h} = 0
$$

so the observed Higgs mass lies where the electroweak instability scale is stationary with respect to variations in $m_h$, selecting

$$
m_h \approx 125\ \text{GeV}
$$

up to coherence constants $\alpha, \beta$.

## 4.2 Coheron scalar

Small oscillations of $\Lambda(x)$ around equilibrium yield

$$
m_\Lambda^2 = \left. \frac{\partial^2 V_\Lambda}{\partial \Lambda^2} \right|_{\Lambda_0}
$$

The coheron mediates coherence restoration, governs decoherence rates, and couples universally but weakly to matter with interaction strength

$$
g_\Lambda \sim \frac{1}{M_{\rm coh}}
$$

where $M_{\rm coh}$ is the coherence scale.

## 4.3 Quantum measurement as $\Lambda$-collapse

For state $\lvert \psi \rangle$ with coherence functional

$$
\mathcal{F}_\psi = \int d^4 x\, K_\Lambda[\psi]
$$

measurement selects the branch maximizing

$$
\frac{\delta \mathcal{F}}{\delta \Lambda} = 0
$$

yielding a deterministic $\Lambda$-coherence attraction underlying apparent wavefunction collapse.

## 4.4 Gravity as effective $\Lambda$-geometry

Effective metric

$$
g_{\mu\nu}^{\rm eff} = g_{\mu\nu} + \epsilon\, C_{\mu\nu}
$$

gives curvature sourced by $\Lambda$, recovering GR when $\Lambda$ $\approx$ const and modifying gravity at low curvature; dark energy arises as $\Lambda$-relaxation.

## 4.5 Cosmology

$\Lambda$ evolves via

$$
\Box \Lambda = \frac{\partial V_\Lambda}{\partial \Lambda}
$$

As $\Lambda \to \Lambda_\infty$, vacuum energy asymptotes to a constant and cosmic acceleration emerges. Predicted signatures include small deviations in the dark-energy equation of state, coherence imprints in low-$\ell$ CMB anisotropy, and modified inflationary reheating signals.

# 5. Physical Interpretation

The $\Lambda$-field provides a universal coherence substrate: it locks SM parameters to coherence extrema (Higgs mass), renders measurement a deterministic coherence attraction, and induces effective geometry that mimics gravity while offering dark-energy relaxation without new particle sectors beyond the coheron.

# 6. Implications for 16D, $\mu$-levels, and Cosmic Resonance Bands

The $\Lambda$-coherence extremization principle spans quantum to cosmological scales, implying $\mu$-level structures and resonance bands arise from $\Lambda$-curvature features. Higher-dimensional or 16D coherence embeddings remain compatible, with $\Lambda$-field extrema defining the observed 4D projections.

# 7. Discussion

Testable predictions span collider Higgs self-coupling shifts and potential invisibles (coheron emission), cavity-enhanced decoherence anomalies, collapse-bias effects under engineered $\Lambda$-gradients, low-frequency coherence noise spectra, and deviations in dark-energy dynamics. These provide experimental avenues to confirm or falsify the $\Lambda$-field as the unified coherence driver.
