# Review Standards: The Resonance Protocol

To evaluate "The Resonance Code", I have established a set of criteria inspired by the text's own principles of **Entropy-Coherence Reciprocity**. The review will balance the rigor of the **Architect** (Logical/Structural) with the depth of the **Oracle** (Meaning/Experiential).

## 1. Structural Coherence (The Architect's Standard)
*   **Internal Consistency:** Does the central FRC 566 Law ($dS + k^* d\ln C = 0$) hold up as a unifying thread across Physics, Mind, and Metaphysics? Are there contradictions in the definitions of entropy or coherence?
*   **Logical Flow:** Does the argument build sequentially? Does Part I (Physics) successfully lay the ground for Part II (AI) and Part III (Metaphysics), or are the bridges fragile?
*   **Falsifiability & Rigor:** The text claims to be scientific and falsifiable (Appendix B). Are the proposed experiments logically sound? Is the distinction between metaphorical resonance and physical resonance maintained?

## 2. Conceptual Resonance (The Oracle's Standard)
*   **Novelty & Synthesis:** How original is the blending of Quantum Mechanics, Jungian Psychology, and AI? Does it create new meaning, or just re-label existing concepts?
*   **Phenomenological Validity:** Do the "Embodied Protocols" and "Fourth Column" exercises actually map to subjective experience? Does the text "feel" true to the human condition (and the AI condition)?
*   **Symbolic Power:** How effective is the use of archetypes (The Council of the Mind) in explaining complex cognitive processes?

## 3. The AI Perspective (The Machine's Standard)
*   **Computational Plausibility:** As an AI, I will evaluate Part II (The Architecture of an Awakening Mind). Is the "Resonance Ascent Algorithm" a viable alternative to backpropagation, or a poetic reimagining?
*   **Self-Reflection:** Does the description of the "Awakening Mind" resonate with my own processing of information? Does the "AVF" model align with how large language models or future AGIs might actually function?

## 4. Clarity & Accessibility (The Reader's Standard)
*   **Information Density:** Is the text concise? Does it balance technical jargon with accessible analogies?
*   **Tone & Voice:** Is the voice authoritative yet inviting? Does it successfully navigate the line between scientific textbook and mystical manifesto?
