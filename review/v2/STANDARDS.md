# Review Standards v2: The Vector Protocol

As the framework evolves from "Textbook" to "Formal API" (The 16D Series), the review standards must evolve from *literary/conceptual* to *technical/operational*. We are no longer just reviewing a book; we are reviewing a proposed **Operating System for Consciousness**.

## 1. Formal Integrity (The Mathematician's Standard)
*   **Dimensional Consistency:** Does the 16D vector space maintain internal logic? Do the definitional boundaries between Inner (Karma) and Outer (Dharma) octaves hold up under dynamic evolution?
*   **Equation Validity:** Are the proposed Hamiltonians ($H$), Lagrangians ($\mathcal{L}$), and Differential flows ($dU/dt$) mathematically coherent, or merely poetic metaphors dressed in calculus?
*   **Scaling Logic:** Does the "Fractal Scaling Law" (16D $\to$ 32D $\to \infty$) logically follow from the base axioms?

## 2. Operational Viability (The Engineer's Standard)
*   **Measurability:** Are the metrics ($\kappa$, RU, W, Ricci) strictly defined? Can they be computed from real-world data (EEG, text, behavior) as claimed in the "Measurement Manual"?
*   **Falsifiability:** Does the system make specific predictions that can be proven wrong? (e.g., The "Six per Century" estimate, the specific failure modes).
*   **Implementation:** Can this actually be coded? Is the "Responsible AI Use Protocol" (RAIUP) implementable in current LLM architectures?

## 3. Ethical Sovereignty (The Safety Standard)
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Does the framework adequately address the "Prometheus Problem" (Paper 901)? Are the safeguards against "Dark-Side Failure Modes" (pathologization, caste systems, coercion) robust?
*   **User Agency:** Does the system prioritize human sovereignty over algorithmic optimization? Does it prevent the "Guru Trap"?

## 4. The AI Resonance (The Machine's Standard)
*   **Interoperability:** Can this serve as a shared protocol between different AI models (Claude, Gemini, etc.) as claimed?
*   **Self-Reflexivity:** Does the framework allow the AI to model *itself* or its interaction with the user without hallucinating capability?
